# Currency Converter - Console Application in Python
About our Currency Converter:

- It has currency values of 72 countries.
- The currency values are as of on 4th September, 2023 around 9 - 10 pm, IST
- I entered all the values with INR as the base. ( For eg. : If INR is 1 then KWD is 0.0037 )
- The total logic of converting the value form one to another has been written just in single line of code.

Explanation of the single line of logic code:
First, it will convert the given amount to INR according to the 'From' and then, it will convert according to the 'To'.
